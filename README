Liquid Lens Camera Auto-Focus Implementation

The source code was implemented as part of Bachelors Thesis - Real Time Liuqid Lens Focusing.

The thesis compares the traditional electro-mechanical lenses to their liquid alternatives.
Its primary concern is finding the exact figures about how faster the liquid lenses focus.

The auto-focus algorithm is a very basic one, as it is only used as an example for the comparison.

Overall the thesis proved, that focusing with liquid lens is several times faster in any tested scenario.
